The base template can be copied from the github repo
[here](https://github.com/nmacinnis/pragmatic_testing/tree/gh-pages/00_template).
Feel free to use it.


The format is 20 slides, auto-advancing at 15 second intervals, which
makes for a talk exactly 5 minutes long. This comes from [Ignite](http://www.ignitetalks.io/).
It's a good format for communicating a single idea. The restrictions
impose a time limit and a cadence, so the speaker can't get stuck on a
boring topic for too long. It's also good just for practicing speaking.


I use the [Takahashi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Takahashi_method) or
Lessig method, which works well in Ignite talks. Bullet points and long
sentences are usually bad in a short presentation. Cut the long sentences
down to the fewest words possible, and put each bullet point on its own slide.


I find it helpful to let the slides advance a little bit ahead of what I'm
saying, so that they provide cues and keep the talk on course. If you outrun
your slides, you risk running out of things to say, which makes for awkward
pauses.
